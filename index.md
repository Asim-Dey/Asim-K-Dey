I am a  Visiting Research Collaborator in the Department of Electrical Engineering (EE) at Princeton University and a Postdoctoral Research Associate at The University of  Texas at Dallas. I work jointly with H. Vincent Poor at Princeton University and Yulia R. Gel at The University of Texas at Dallas. In Summer 2019 I received my PhD from the department of Mathematical Sciences at The University of Texas at Dallas under the advice of Yulia R. Gel.  In Fall 2017 I was a Visiting Graduate Research Fellow  at Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute ([SAMSI](https://www.samsi.info/)), NC.
