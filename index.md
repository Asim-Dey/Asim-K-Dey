I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). Before joining UTEP I was Visiting Research Collaborator in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University and a Postdoctoral Research Associate at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). While at UTD and Princeton University, I worked jointly with [H. Vincent Poor](https://ee.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor) and [Yulia R. Gel](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~yxg142030/). In Fall 2017 I was a Visiting Graduate Research Fellow at Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI), NC.
