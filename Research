I am broadly interested in statistical methods for complex networks and blockchains methodology, topological data analysis, reliability and risk quantification, extreme value modeling, and their application to security, climatology, and finance. Currently, I am particularly interested in the functions, reliability, and resilience of interconnected complex networks.   

The past two decades have seen increasing interest in the application of tools developed in the interdisciplinary field of network analysis to improve our understanding of complex systems and critical infrastructures, e.g., transportation systems, power grids,  food supplies, and ecosystems, Internet of Things (IoT).  Such complex systems are vulnerable to failure from various causes including natural disasters, aging, and intentional attacks such as terrorism.  We develop a number of advanced graph-analytical methods for resilience quantification and threat detection on (interconnected) complex networks. The new resilience metrics incorporate local higher order structures and their intrinsic geometry into robustness and reliability analysis of complex networks.
